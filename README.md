# Custom Monketype Themes

To apply a custom theme to ```monkeytype.com```:
- Install the ```Stylus``` extension on a browser that supports it.
- Then create a style on ```Stylus``` for ```monkeytype.com``` and paste/save the code from ```file.css```.

If your version doesn't look exactly like mine you and you want it to:
- Import ```byun-settings.txt``` in settings. Keep in mind that this will delete your settings so make sure to export yours before doing do in case.

If the keyboard positioning is off:
- You can try fiddling with the section titled ```/* Typing */```.
- You should see ```#typingTest``` which is both the text and keyboard.
	- For text only go to ```#wordsWrapper```.
	- For keyboard only go to ```.keymap```.

If the keyboard looks weird:
- Try refreshing. I find that when I apply a page style from ```Stylus```, some elements often look off which immediately gets resolved after a refresh.
